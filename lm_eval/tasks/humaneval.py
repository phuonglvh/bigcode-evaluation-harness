"""Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code
https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374

The HumanEval dataset released by OpenAI includes 164 programming problems with a function signature,
docstring, body, and several unit tests. 
They were handwritten to ensure not to be included in the training set of code generation models.
